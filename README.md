Yii 2 MEDITATION CENTRE
===============================

This is a group project of unit IFB299, QUT.
In Scenario, as the development team, we need to build a website that can help manager of meditation centre to manage enrolment, volunteer participation and course creation.

There are 3 type of courses, which may be 3-day, 10-day and 30-day course. New participant may only register for 10-day course. Once he finished the 10-day course, he could register for another 2 different courses or choose to volunteer in centre.
