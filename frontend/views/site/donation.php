    <p>
      Whilst we are a non-profit organisation and love all the contribution that the community and our participants donate to our centre,
      we do accept donations through our web page and prefer you to send your contributions through to our main reception at the meditation centre.
      &nbsp;
      Thank you for your understanding and support all these years and we hope to see you in the centre soon!\

    </p>
